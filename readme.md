# TModLoader Docker Server

All you have to do is use the `docker-compose.yml` file to spin up a TModLoader server using Docker Compose. Make sure to edit the volume paths to your liking. You can also build the Docker image yourself using the `Dockerfile`, but you don't have to. You also don't need to clone the repository. Just use the `docker-compose.yml` file. I just made this to access ARM64 builds of TModLoader since the popular Docker image only supports x86_64.
